<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	I have been in the financial industry for just over 10 years now. As you can
	see within my resume, i started in customer service on the phones, and quickly
	made my way into leadership. I relocated to Birmingham, Alabama for a career
	advancement opportunity that proved to be a wonderful move. There, I gained
	the necessary skills to be succuessful in leading and managing my own team,
	and shortly after became a manager within Customer Service. After being a
	manager for a couple of years, i relocated back to Charlotte, North Carolina
	where I continued in my role as a Manager. In late 2019, i decided that it was
	time for a change for me, and began applying into different positions that
	interested me, to broaded my experience and knowledge. In February 2022, I
	started in a new role that was considered as an individual contributor role,
	as opposed to managing and being responsible for a team. I was promoted to a
	more senior version of that role at the end of 2020, and i have been here ever
	since. I won't go into detail here about what this role entails, you can read
	about that within my resume. However, what i will say is that while my time in
	this role has been exteremly valuable, I am ready for a change. That is why I
	am learning coding and web development. This has always intrigued me, as well
	as intimidated me. But recently i decided to enroll in a course to help teach
	me about coding and web development, so that i can see if it is something that
	i would like to pursue as a potential career opportunity in the future.

	I am a hard working, analytical person that loves to solve problems. In my
	spare time i enjoy playing with my two dogs, Luna and Georgia, playing video
	games, spending time with/annoying my wife, and working on cars (if i have a
	toy to work on at that time). I used to have a 2001 Chevrolet Camaro that i
	built myself. It was very fun to build, and exteremly fun to drive. I sold
	that car when my wife and i matched with a birth mother for our adoption
	journey. Unfortunately, that situtation did not work out. That is partially
	the reason i am interest in making a career change. I have stayed in my
	current job with Wells because they offer great benefits for adoption and for
	new parents ( i was really looking forward to that parental leave). But the
	job no longer interested me or challenged me like i wanted. It wasn't
	something i truly enjoyed, and i began to feel burnt out. But i have stuck
	with it for so long because i make good money, get to work from home half the
	time, and the benefits are good. But i am ready for a change, to do something
	i actually enjoy and something where i look forward to going to work every day
	instead of dreading it. I may be a new coder/web developer, but i am motivated
	to learn everything i can as quickly as i can so that i can gain the necessary
	knowledge and skills to thrive in this new world. Thank you for taking the
	time to read this and learn a little bit more about me. I hope we get a chance
	to speak more.
